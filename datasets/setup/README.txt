No bugs that I know of. I attempted to insert duplicate data into fields
that are primary key to verify that would result in an error. I also attempted
to insert duplicate data into a unique field and made sure the field cannot be
added. I also tried to drop a table that is being referenced to confirm that it
cannot be dropped as long as it is referenced. I also confirmed that the same
table can be dropped once the table referencing it was dropped first.

Note: I also submitted an extra dataset for extra credit.
